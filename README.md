# Weather-CityPy----Challenge-6
Kyle Novak's Challenge 6 from Module 6

Greetings,

Thank you for taking the time to review my Challenge 6 and sorry for turning it in past the due date.

This exercise was a challenge for me, but I am glad that I was able to gain an understanding of it over time.

You can find my python coding for WeatherPy and CityPy in their respected ipynb files that are attached in this repo.

Figures from WeatherPY can be accessed as well in the repo.

Please reach out should you have any questions.

Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
